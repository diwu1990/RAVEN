# RAVEN
A Reconfigurable Architecture for Varying Emerging Neural Networks and Beyond (RAVEN), architected in a bottom-up manner.
RAVEN leverages approximate computing and reconfigurable computing to improve the hardware efficiencies upon complicated applications.

## Requirement
1. PyTorch

## Directory
1. Dir **_app_**  includes the example applications.
2. Dir **_hw_**   includes the RTL implementations (subjected to changes).
3. Dir **_pe_**   includes the PyTorch-based nonlinear operations.
4. Dir **_test_** includes the test examples for customized nonlinear operations in dir **_pe_**.
