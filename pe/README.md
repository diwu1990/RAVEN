RAVEN PE is fully configurable, and can act as both linear and nonlinear functions:

    1. multiplication    
    2. addition
    3. division
    4. exponentiation
    5. logarithm

Currently, RAVEN PE supports two different algorithm schemes:

    1. Taylor series based
    2. log2 based
