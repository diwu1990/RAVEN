RAVEN processing element (PE) is supposed to configurable, and can act as both linear and nonlinear functions, including

    1. Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)
    2. Division
    3. Exponentiation
    4. Logarithm
    5. ...

There exists multiple versions of PEs.

1. SECO: A Scalable Accuracy Approximate Exponential Function Via Cross-Layer Optimization. In ISLPED'19.
2. UNO: Virtualizing and Unifying Nonlinear Operations for Emerging Neural Networks. In ISLPED'21.
